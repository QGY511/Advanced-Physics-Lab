# Advanced Physics Lab: Muon Decay and CMB Analysis

This project focuses on the data analysis of Muon decay and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) using Jupyter notebooks. 

## Description

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Muon Decay: I analyzed the data from the lab experiment on Muon decay. This includes data preprocessing, fitting an exponential decay function, and determining the mean lifetime of the Muon.

2. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): I analyzed radiometric data to study the CMB in the second part. This includes data cleaning, plotting the power spectrum, and fitting a theoretical model.

## Getting Started

I recommend installing Anaconda first. 

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas...
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas...
