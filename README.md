# Advanced Physics Lab: Muon Decay and CMB Analysis

This project focuses on the data analysis of Muon decay and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) using Jupyter notebooks. 

## Description

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Muon Decay: In this part, we analyze the data from our lab experiment on Muon decay. This includes data preprocessing, fitting an exponential decay function, and determining the mean lifetime of the Muon.

2. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): In the second part, we analyze data from the Planck satellite to study the CMB. This includes data cleaning, plotting the power spectrum, and fitting a theoretical model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, astropy (These can be installed using pip)
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas astropy
